# Kolektivo Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Pledge

Kolektivo is a community of contributors, leaders, and other members that pledge to create a harassment-free experience in our Kolektivo community for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender, experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We commit to contributing to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

Our goal is to foster good open source citizenship by recognizing and strengthening the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Positive action is essential to counteract inequality and abuses of power in society. If you see someone fostering a welcoming and friendly community, please let us know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

Community members are expected to:

- Participate authentically and actively, contributing to the community's health and longevity.
- Exercise consideration and respect in speech and actions.
- Prioritize collaboration before conflict.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or any violations of this Code of Conduct.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed at another person.
- Discriminatory jokes, language, and content.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Doxing (posting someoneâ€™s personal information without consent).
- Insults related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Recording and photography without consent.
- Unwelcome sexual attention, including sexualized comments, jokes, inappropriate touching, and unwelcome advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in-person).
- Encouraging any of the above behavior.
- Disrupting community events, including talks and presentations.
- Any conduct that might reasonably be expected to cause offense or humiliation, including derogatory comments about sexual orientation or gender identity, name-calling, and inappropriate sexual gestures.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Community organizers may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible via labs@kolektivo.co.

## 7. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community participants (staff, contributors, sponsors, and other guests) in all community venues, online and in-person, and in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside community activities when such behavior negatively impacts the safety and well-being of community members.

## 8. Prohibition of Retaliation

Threats, intimidation, or any form of retaliation against a participant who has made a complaint or provided information in support of a complaint are prohibited. The community organizers will take any appropriate action needed to prevent and respond to retaliation.

## 9. Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
