# Contributing

Kolektivo is open source and we welcome open participation!

## Contributing PRs

Find an area that is of interest and you would like to help with. If you’d like to dig deeper, feel free to look at other labels and TODO’s in code comments. If there’s an issue you’re interested in contributing to or taking over, assign yourself to it and add a comment with your plans to address and target timeline. If there’s already someone assigned to it, please check with them before adding yourself to the assignee list.

Tasks range from minor to major improvements. Based on your interests, skillset, and level of comfort with the code-base feel free to contribute where you see appropriate. We encourage you to PR \(pull request\) your work regularly and often to solicit feedback and to ensure everyone has an idea of what you’re working on. If you’ve just started, we suggest creating a PR with “WIP” \(Work In Progress\) in the title and let us know when it’s ready to review in the comments.

Kolektivo is part of the Celo community and follows Kolektivo's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zed-io/kolektivo/blob/kolektivo/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Contributing _substantial_ changes

A substantial change is one that significantly alters the user experience or an underlying implementation. For example, we would consider the following as examples of substantial changes:

- Adding support for in-app swaps.
- Changing how Kolektivo calculates asset value in local fiat.
- Changing Kolektivo's branding (_e.g.,_ color palette).
- Adding a way for Kolektivo users to go through decentralized KYC.
- Removing screens from on-boarding.

If you're considering making what might be a substantial change, we strongly encourage you to reach out to the Kolektivo engineering team first. We might have suggestions that guide the implementation and make it easier to implement a high-quality change to Kolektivo with the least amount of work. `Kolektivo Wallet Builders` on Kolektivo's [Telegram channel](https://t.me/+JdPqRy6S2lA2NzM1) is a great way to contact us.
