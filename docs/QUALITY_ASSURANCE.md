- Identify and fix defects early in the development process.
- Maintain a high standard of code quality.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and best practices.

## Scope

The QA process applies to all stages of the Kolektivo Blockchain Wallet development, including:

- Requirement analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

## Testing Methodologies

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Objective**: Validate the functionality of individual components.
- **Tools**: Jest, Mocha, Chai.
- **Frequency**: Continuous, as part of the development process.

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure different components of the wallet work together as expected.
- **Tools**: Postman, Jest, Supertest.
- **Frequency**: After unit testing and before system testing.

### 3. System Testing

- **Objective**: Validate the wallet's end-to-end functionality.
- **Tools**: Selenium, Appium, Detox.
- **Frequency**: After integration testing and before user acceptance testing.

### 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Objective**: Ensure the wallet meets user requirements and is ready for deployment.
- **Tools**: Custom scripts, user feedback forms.
- **Frequency**: Before deployment to production.

### 5. Performance Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the wallet performs well under expected load conditions.
- **Tools**: JMeter, LoadRunner.
- **Frequency**: During system testing.

### 6. Security Testing

- **Objective**: Identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Frequency**: During system testing and after any major changes.

### 7. Regression Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure new changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.
- **Tools**: Selenium, Appium, Detox.
- **Frequency**: After every code change.

## Tools

- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Project Management**: Jira, Trello
- **Testing**: Jest, Selenium, Appium, Detox, JMeter, OWASP ZAP
- **Communication**: Slack, Email

## Reporting & Metrics

- **Bug Reports**: All bugs are reported in Jira with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and severity levels.
- **Test Coverage**: Regular reports on test coverage using tools like Istanbul.
- **Performance Metrics**: Load times, transaction processing times, and other relevant metrics are monitored and reported.

## Review & Audit

- Regular QA reviews are conducted to ensure adherence to standards.
- External audits may be conducted to ensure compliance with regulations.

## Continuous Improvement

- Post-release reviews to identify areas for improvement.
- Regular training sessions for the QA team to stay updated with the latest tools and methodologies.
